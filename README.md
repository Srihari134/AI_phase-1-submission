## AI BASED DIABETES PREDICTION SYSTEM USING MECHINE LEARNING 

This project is an AI-based diabetes prediction system utilizing machine learning techniques. Below are instructions on how to run the code and any dependencies required.

## Requirements

To run this code, you will need the following dependencies installed:
Python (3.x recommended)
Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebook)
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

## Installation
To install the necessary libraries, you can use pip, assuming Python is already installed. Run the following command:
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone <https://github.com/Srihari134/AI_phase-1-submission.git>

Navigate to the project directory:
cd AI-Diabetes-Prediction

## Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook AI_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
The Jupyter Notebook will open in your default web browser. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code and make predictions.

## Usage
The provided Jupyter Notebook (AI_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb) contains the necessary code to train the machine learning model and perform diabetes predictions. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to:
Load and preprocess the dataset
Train the machine learning model
Evaluate the model's performance
Make predictions on new data.

## DESCRIPTION 
The AI-based diabetes prediction system aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health metrics and historical data. Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyze a dataset containing relevant health information and to build a predictive model. This model, once trained, can be used to make predictions on new data to identify potential cases of diabetes.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It consists of several health-related features such as glucose level, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, and other attributes, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

Data Source:Refered at kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/yarlagaddasaimanoj/diabetes-prediction-using-ml-algorithms)

Data Description: Contains health metrics and a diabetes indicator.

## Usage
The provided Jupyter Notebook (AI_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb) contains the necessary code to train the machine learning model and perform diabetes predictions. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to:

Load and preprocess the dataset
Train the machine learning model
Evaluate the model's performance
Make predictions on new data
Model Deployment
For deployment of the model in a real-world scenario, consider using the trained model and integrating it into an application or a web service.

## Notes
Ensure the dataset used is properly formatted and matches the structure expected by the provided code.
For any issues or questions, refer to the comments within the Jupyter Notebook or contact the project contributors.
